👀 I’m interested in software development, machine learning, AI, open-source contributions, and building scalable systems.
🌱 I’m currently learning advanced Python, deep learning, cloud computing (AWS/GCP), and blockchain development.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open-source projects, building AI models, web development, or any cool coding projects.
